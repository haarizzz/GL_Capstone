# GL_Capstone

This is my capstone project during my post graduate program at Great Lakes Institute of Management.

• Project Title:	Anomaly Detection and Correction using Sentiment Analysis
• Objective: to identify any inconsistencies between the ratings and the reviews given by a customer, thereby confirming if the rating is in-line with the review and rectifying the ratings. 
• Outcome: The prediction model would help the products in the e-retail platform to get the actual customer ratings, thus improving the user experience and reliability while choosing the products thereby impacting the product’s sales.
Key skills: NLP tools, Logistic Regression, Tf-IDF.
